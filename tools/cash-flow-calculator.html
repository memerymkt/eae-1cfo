<h2>Reading Your Results</h2>
<p>The calculator provides detailed cash flow analysis across three categories. Operating cash flow shows cash generated from core business activities after accounting for expenses. Positive operating cash flow indicates healthy business operations. Investing cash flow tracks cash used for long-term assets and investments. Negative investing cash flow is common for growing businesses. Financing cash flow shows cash from loans, equity, or repayments. Net cash flow combines all categories to show overall cash position change. Compare results against industry benchmarks and historical performance.</p>
<h2>Cash Flow Formula</h2>
<p>Cash flow calculation follows standard accounting principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - Changes in Working Capital</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Operating cash flow measures cash generated from business operations. Net income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. This formula shows true cash generation from core activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing Cash Flow = - (Capital Expenditures + Investments)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Investing cash flow tracks cash used for long-term investments. Typically negative as businesses invest in growth. Includes equipment purchases and business acquisitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financing Cash Flow = Debt Issuance - Debt Repayment + Equity Issuance - Dividends</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Financing cash flow shows cash from capital sources. Includes loans, equity investments, and distributions to owners. Positive financing cash flow indicates capital inflows.</p>
<h2>Improving Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Several strategies can help businesses improve cash flow management. First, accelerate receivables by offering early payment discounts and following up on overdue accounts. Second, optimize inventory through just-in-time purchasing and regular stock reviews. Third, negotiate better supplier terms to extend payment periods and reduce costs. Fourth, improve pricing by analyzing profit margins and adjusting pricing strategies. Fifth, monitor expenses regularly and eliminate unnecessary spending to preserve cash.</p>
